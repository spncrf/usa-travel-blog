We chose to travel to North Dakota for a quick weekend camping trip to visit a friend of Natalie's working as a state park interpreter for the summer. Unknown to us, when it comes to the park system, "interpreter" has little to do with an extensive knowledge of languages and much to do with an extensive knowledge of nature and history and how to make teaching it interesting.

When we arrived at Lewis and Clark State Park in Epping, North Dakota at 11:50 pm - an hour later than expected due to an unexpected time zone change - everything was dark and quiet. Most camping spots for the park are RV hookups, unless you want to risk a walk-in option. We decided to book an RV spot, but decided that the RV would be just _slightly_ out of our budget. So, we opted to stay in the car. After backing into our spot, we set up "camp".

To transform the Chevy Equinox into a campers paradise, we put up a dashboard sun reflector to keep out the next day's 100 degree weather. A last-minute Walmart run the day prior resulted in two window cling curtains that we picked up for $4. **Paradise**üå¥üåû .

Except...not quite. Despite Natalie‚Äôs car being a great cargo carrier, it is not the greatest people-sleeper. Luckily, we're still pretty fresh out of college and able to survive and thrive on very poor sleep.

Saturday morning, while Spencer slept in, Natalie caught up with her dear friend at the park. We then enjoyed an extravagant camping breakfast of bagels, cream cheese, smoked salmon, and capers. We‚Äôre not sure how the capers made their way onto our camping shopping list, but figure it has to do with committing the cardinal sin of going grocery shopping (er, planning) while hungry. Park interpreter hours start at 12:30, so after our late lunch, we said goodbye and got ready to visit the park‚Äôs beach.

We weren‚Äôt sure what we expected for a beach in the middle of nowhere North Dakota, but we thought the juxtaposition was funny. On the right, you‚Äôll see a beautiful sprawling beach reminiscent of the lakes in the upper midwest. On the left, you see a well-manicured farm field with bales of hay sprinkled around. The beach itself is more soil than sand (I guess that explains the great farming next door) which makes the water itself pretty murky. The water only goes as deep as your waist before you reach the debris line, so as far as adult swimming goes, it's not the greatest beach. However, it was a nice day and a great chance to dip our toes in the water, cool off, and chat.

For what we thought was some random state park, there were a surprising amount of people there for the weekend and the park itself was a good size. In addition to the beachfront, it had a marina down the road, plenty of open fields, winding hiking paths through the park, and even two large jungle gyms. Though a fairly average park compared to most states, it‚Äôs possible to see what the draw would be for residents in North Dakota or those just stopping by.

During our pre-camping shopping trip, we drafted up potential ideas for easy meatless meals. After swimming, we made tortilla, hummus, tofu, and veggie wraps before taking an outdoor nap in the shade. The park interpreter runs three shows a week--on Friday and Saturday evenings and one on Sunday morning. We were curious what Natalie‚Äôs friend‚Äôs show would be all about and so, after, a brief walk ended up at the park‚Äôs amphitheater as she was setting up. The topic of the presentation was 'Hunting and Gathering' and involved searching for pictures of animals and bags of nuts and berries in the surrounding woods - the same kind Lewis and Clark would have found along their way. The nuts and berries were then combined into a trail mix that we took as a souvenir from the show.

After the show finished, we were confused to hear the familiar sounds of an ice cream truck jingling from outside the amphitheater. What was probably the only ice cream truck in this sparsely populated state had traveled into the park and seemed to be making a killing with how many people were lined up in front of it. We of course each got a treat. The truck surprisingly took Venmo and even more surprisingly we had an internet connection at the park.

Wanting to make the most of the drive to the park, and this being our last day, we decided to do a quick google search to see what other attractions were nearby. We stumbled across Fort Union Trading Post just outside of Epping. As we rounded a hill of the rocky, sagebrush covered landscape, the massive trading post revealed itself. With the parking lot hidden around the corner, they truly worked hard to make it look like we imagined it would back when it was frequented in the 1800s. The interpreters at the trading post were dressed in full attire and spoke as if they still lived in that time, each taking on a different occupation. We learned from a barrel maker who taught us what a ‚Äúbuttload‚Äù is (a butt is the largest size of barrel and a buttload is the amount of something that fits in said butt) and about the native americans and trappers that would visit the trading post.

As Fort Union lies just over the border of North Dakota, we of course had to take pictures from North Dakota and Montana.

The five hour drive back to Billings looked quite different from the first as the air had now filled with smoke from faraway forest fires. Though it was a great trip, we learned our lesson that a five hour destination would be a great distance for a followup Airbnb stay but not so great for a weekend getaway.
