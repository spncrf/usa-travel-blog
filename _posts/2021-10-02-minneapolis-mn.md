The drive from Billings to Minneapolis is longer than you‚Äôd expect. Clocking in at 13 hours of driving, the path only took us through one other state, South Dakota. However, the sheer size of these states and the position of the two destination cities made the drive a long haul and longer still with our stops and detours along with way. By the time we arrived at our final destination, we had spent roughly 22 hours in the car (how‚Äôs that for working from road? üòâ). 

The main attraction we had planned to stop and see on our way through was Badlands National Park. It‚Äôs a slight turn off the main highway but a 30-minute drive through the park puts you back on track. After entering the park, we walked over to the lookout to take some pictures and do some quick exploring.

</figure>

We then realized the mistake we had made. Rather than entering the park on the western side, we had entered at the easternmost entrance. Our options were then to continue east, exiting the park immediately after we had entered it, or work our way through the park and effectively add an hour to our drive. Wanting to get the most out of our very brief National Park trip (or, at least, a little more time than our previous Yellowstone visit), we decided to take the longer way. Along the way, we stopped to take in more of the park and for a short hike deep into the landscape. The views were gorgeous, and we ended up being grateful to have taken the longer route ‚Äì even if we ended up arriving at 2am.

Outside of the Badlands, we also encountered a field full of prairie dogs right next to one of the few gas stations. Clearly they had been overfed from the constant stream of tourists coming through the area.

Now, it should be said that we did not *technically* stay in Minneapolis. Our Airbnb was in the town of Owatonna. About an hour each way from Minneapolis, Mankato, and Rochester, Owatonna is a much sleepier town that was chosen because of the Airbnb itself. 

The cozy, basement stay of a two-story home had plenty of space, a large desk, and a good-sized kitchen. While in a great location, we truthfully didn‚Äôt spend too much time exploring the city surrounding our cozy Airbnb. Walking-distance trips to a clearly popular local ice cream shop, an up-and-coming brewery (we just barely missed their Oktoberfest celebration ‚òπÔ∏è), and the nearby parks and trails that got us to those destinations mostly define our time in Owatonna. In true Midwest fashion, we visited the nearby Kwik Trip at least half a dozen times üòä.

Don‚Äôt get us wrong - we weren‚Äôt homebodies for the entire month. Since working from road takes up as much time as it does during the week, and we had so many things to do and see, our weekends filled up very quickly.  

The weekend we arrived in Minneapolis was the final weekend of the two-week long Minnesota State Fair. Neither of us had been before, but Natalie‚Äôs family has attended for the past few years and so we were excited to check it out. In fact, we still are excited to visit some time in the future, since we ending up passing this year. We would have only been able to attend the final day and wanted to spend time with family that had come to visit, so we instead decided to create our own state fair at Natalie‚Äôs sister‚Äôs house. Using the air fryer, we made the typical fair foods of fried cheese curds, jalapeno poppers, popcorn chicken, and fried pickles along the not so typical fare of fried tofu nuggets dipped in honey mustard (a Spencer creation).

The following weekend, we went on a trip to northeast Iowa to visit Natalie‚Äôs grandma. Grandma has a lot of hobbies and all of them involve crafting of some sort - so we were very busy the whole weekend with lots of quirky art projects. We painted concrete leaves, made beaded chains and bracelets, cooked, baked, and enjoyed quality time chatting together.

Located in a very rural area, there is a large Amish population near Grandma‚Äôs house. Natalie had grown up going to their stores whenever she visited and proposed we do that while visiting. Though religious fundamentalist groups aren‚Äôt anything new coming from Idaho, it was a new experience for Spencer. On Saturday, we went to three different Amish stores - two of which sold extremely discounted damaged and surplus grocery items and the other which sold bulk items.

We stocked up on lots of grocery essentials and fun finds before saying see you later to Grandma and heading back to Owatonna.

The Twin Cities area is a great place for tabletop game lovers. Home to the US headquarters of two prominent board game publishers, we simply had to check them out. Luckily for us, on our third weekend, there was a small board game convention taking place near St. Paul - an offshoot of the larger [GenCon](https://www.gencon.com/) convention taking place the same weekend in Indianapolis. We got to play some brand-new board games along with some that were just new to us. We got to speak with some of the vendors and played a few convention-only games like a Cornhole/Settlers of Catan crossover (which turned out to be more fun than was expected). Since the convention lasted all weekend, we considered going back again, but all the other events kept us too busy!

Natalie had purchased a sourdough starter from Etsy while we were in Montana but only had the chance to make one failed loaf. After some more research and with exciting new flours from the Amish bulk store, she was successful in her efforts! The loaves turned out beautifully and were delicious. She baked them early Saturday morning before we headed back to the city for a full day of Minneapolis activities.

When in Minneapolis, Mall of America is the obvious tourist destination. We rode a few rides and journeyed across the mall ‚Äì managing to only visit a small fraction of possible stores. We also enjoyed authentic Indian food from the in-house food court. Well, as authentic a place like that can be in the ‚ÄúMall of America‚Äù.

Despite being such a large urban center, Minneapolis/St. Paul is sprawling enough to contain and preserve some natural beauty. One such example is a park in the middle of downtown that contains the beautiful Minnehaha Falls. Clearly very popular due to its lack of available parking spaces, we located the bubbling river that cut through the park and followed it up to its source at the falls. Access to the falls was blocked off by fencing. While Spencer wanted to join the large groups of people blatantly disregarding these fences and getting closer to the roaring falls, Natalie was too much of a rule follower to allow it.

We had placed reservations at a swanky Japanese ramen place on the west side of the city called Moto-i. Though they did not accept reservations for their rooftop seating, we were ecstatic learn that there was one available when we arrived. Our view over the street below allowed us to observe some horrible drivers, poor parallel parking, and a drunk jaywalker or two ‚Äì all from a safe distance. Moto-i is also the first sake brewpub in the world outside of Japan ‚Äì an impressive feat that had surprised us both. Their menu featured plant-based crispy ‚Äúpork‚Äù buns and vegetarian ramen variations we both enjoyed.

Sunday morning, we decided to delve deeper into the natural beauty Minneapolis tries so hard to maintain. Wanting to experience just a few of Minnesota‚Äôs 1,000 lakes, we headed out to the Chain of Lakes region. Connected by interwoven biking and walking paths, Lake of the Isles, Lake Harriet, and Bde Maka Ska (pronounced *buh-DAY' muh-KAH'-skah*, the one we enjoyed saying the most) spanned 15 miles of gorgeous sights. 

Unbeknownst to us, Minneapolis is one of the most bikeable urban areas in the country. As biking was the primary mode of transportation for most of our college experience, we were excited to get back behind the handlebars. For just a few dollars, we were able to rent bikes for our trip around the Chain of Lakes. The beautifully paved paths ran right along the shoreline where we could see people windsurfing and boating while we pedaled.

Almost as well known as the Mall of America is the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden. While most well-known for the spoon holding the cherry, we honestly had no clue that there were dozens more sculptures around the area. Following the winding sidewalk zigzagging up the hill that overlooked the garden, we reached a great place to relax and read in the shade.

Our last stop in our busy Minneapolis weekend was to the area called Dinkytown near the University of Minnesota campus. A bit older and grimier than the other places we had visited, we still wanted to get a sense of what Minneapolis could offer. We grabbed dinner from the ‚ÄúHard Times Cafe‚Äù enjoying huge portion sizes of delicious vegan-ized classics.

One of the fun parts of traveling like this is the ability to attend concerts for music artists that otherwise would have never come to our respective hometowns. We were able to catch the band **Jukebox the Ghost** for their Minneapolis show. Spencer had seen them once before in Birmingham, Alabama and it was the same night he asked Natalie to be his girlfriend üëÄ. Varsity Theater, where the concert was held, was a beautiful venue that included one of the weirdest bathrooms either of us had ever seen. This was one of the first concert‚Äôs Natalie had been to where she actually knew all of the songs, so it was a great night for singing along üòä. 

The final weekend in Minnesota was intended to be spent in Duluth, a popular town on the coast of Lake Superior. However, after a late start Saturday and a looming 6-hour round trip, we decided to stay local. We ended up being able to cross off yet another classic Minnesota activity: picking apples! We visited a local apple orchard with Natalie‚Äôs sister where we listened to live music, ate corndogs and veggie burgers, and had the BEST apple cider donuts before tackling the corn maze. 

Unfortunately, it ended up being more of a corn walk than a corn maze ‚Äì not offering enough twist and turns to sufficiently get lost. We finished our apple orchard visit by visiting the actual orchard with bags in hand. While picking the apples was the easy part, working through them over the next few days with various recipes took some creativity.

Our stay in Owatonna may have been characterized more by our visits elsewhere than our exploration of the town itself, but we enjoyed our month here. When Natalie‚Äôs mom told a friend, who had grown up in Owatonna that it was our destination for the month, his first question was ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù. Though it was a bit of a random choice, the Airbnb was a comfortable oasis. We enjoyed Minneapolis enough that, next time, we might just stay there instead üòä.
