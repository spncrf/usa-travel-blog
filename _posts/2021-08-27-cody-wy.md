Cody, Wyoming is about 1 hour and 45 minutes southeast of Billings, Montana and is a popular base camp for people visiting Yellowstone. If we had planned further ahead, maybe we would have taken more advantage of that.

After our [attempt at car camping](https://workingfromroad.com/epping-nd), we decided to bite the bullet and buy a tent as our lodging of choice for our trip to Cody. After eating at Millstone Pizza in town Friday evening, we made our way 20 minutes west to stay at the North Fork Campground in Buffalo Bill State Park. There are only a few places in the area where tent camping is allowed (apparently bears know how to unzip tents but don't know how to open trailer doors ðŸ˜‰). Though it was dark when we set up camp, the views in the morning were breathtaking.

The Buffalo Bill campsite was located just off a National Scenic byway that spans from Cody to Yellowstone. Being from the Midwest, Natalie wasn't used to seeing so many enormous mountains and so wanted to take the road as far as we could. Along the way, we took several pictures. And, with no real purpose of this drive besides soaking in the view, we weren't afraid to stop at many turnoffs along the way.

Eventually, we reached Yellowstone. However, with only a bit of daylight left and a few hours drive from the east entrance to the park's main attractions, we figured a quick photo outside next to the park sign would be good enough for us ðŸ˜ƒ.

Natalie had bought a Dutch Oven for baking homemade bread which proved to be useful to make meals on trips like these. We opted to use it to make BBQ Nachos - mixing together chopped onion, pepper, pinto beans, black eyed beans, and barbecue sauce, topping it with cheese and serving it alongside tortilla chips. Unfortunately we forgot to take a picture, but it was very delicious and a meal we'd definitely make again, even just at home!

For dessert, we cooked s'mores over the embers of the fire we built for our Dutch Oven and then watched the stars overhead. As I am sure anyone who has been able to look at the open night sky sans light pollution can attest, pictures really don't do the view justice.

Just outside of Buffalo Bill campsite and before the town of Cody itself is a large dam that helps provide power for the small town. It is supermassive and a pretty freaky sight when standing ontop of it and looking downriver. We managed to take a few pictures of the sights and visit the suprisingly impressive museum connected to the dam.

There are a few things within Cody itself that are supposed 'must-sees' for the town, but the most recommended appeared to be The Buffalo Bill Center of the West. After grabbing breakfast at a retro local diner, we headed off to the center. It is a huge building that connects 5 different museums that are related in some way to the Wild West. There were plenty of paintings, artifacts, recreations, and film snippets, though unfortunately the food court was closed. One of the museums centered on William F. "Buffalo Bill" Cody, who has clearly left his mark on the area. With so much to see, we spent about four hours at the center and still didn't manage to see everything we wanted to. There was plenty to learn and see and from our limited experience with the town, we would agree that it would qualify as a 'must-see'.

Leaving Cody to return to Billings, we had to make up for our North Dakota return trip and snap a photo in front of an actual state sign.

Overall, we thought Cody seemed like a fun mountain town. It had its fair share of tourist-y things but many of the roads and homes looked like they could be found anywhere in America (just without the stunning views ðŸ˜‰). We hope to visit Cody and the surrounding area again in the future and maybe next time weâ€™ll factor in enough time to explore Yellowstone.
