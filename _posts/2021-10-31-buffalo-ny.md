One of the goals for the trip was to be in the Northeast during the fall. We both knew that was one of the best times of the year to be in the region and figured it would be a good goal to center our trip around.
 
There were a few destinations that would qualify, but we decided on Buffalo, NY. It would provide a bit of variety in our types of stays and put us in an interesting location in the region. Located on the topmost edge of Lake Erie, Buffalo boasts lots of natural beauty nearby, affordable lodging, and an interesting history, so we thought it would be an alright stay for the month of October.
 
The drive from Minneapolis to Buffalo was a long one and required us to skip a lot of states to make it to upstate New York in time.  To break up the trip a bit and enjoy at least one of the many states we‚Äôd be driving through, we booked a one-night stay Airbnb stay in Ann Arbor, Michigan. We got in late and had an early checkout, so we only had time to briefly tour the University of Michigan and the University district.

The Ann Arbor Airbnb had the power out for most of the night we stayed there üò¨. Upon arriving to Buffalo, unloading the condiments and frozen goods we had transported from Minneapolis was the number one concern. Much to our dismay, though, a good portion of the food had to be tossed out. It‚Äôs an unglamorous reality that comes with having to move so often while maintaining as much conventionality as possible. However, this is just one of the many adjustments we‚Äôve had to make as we‚Äôve gone from stay to stay! üôÇ
 
***
 
The most obvious adjustment is, of course, living in a new city. And, while Buffalo is ‚Äúnew‚Äù to us, it is by all accounts an ‚Äúold‚Äù city. The central downtown contains an impressive skyline, a large waterfront, and a good amount of urban sprawl. In 1950, it had a population of about 580,000 and served as a critical inland port between the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean. It served as a key steel manufacturing operation and was the 15th largest city in the US. Like Detroit‚Äôs degradation, Buffalo‚Äôs booming economy dwindled once auto manufacturers left the Great Lakes area. Now, it only has a population of around 270,000 and sits at the position of 86th largest city in the U.S.
 
During a weekend walk around downtown, we were shocked to see how empty the streets were (though to be fair, we weren‚Äôt in the entertainment district). Many buildings that were once cultural hubs were now boarded up. The skyscrapers, while still towering, had been stained by weather and time. Furthermore, where we stayed on the eastern end of the city, showed clear signs of poverty that made it uncomfortable to want to venture out too much at night. It was sad to see a city that was once the jewel of the country fall so far from grace.

Despite this, we still allocated plenty of time to spend in the city and surrounding area.
 
We visited the ‚Äútheatre‚Äù on two occasions. The first was a surprisingly spacious theatre hall built into the town hall of a nearby village where we watched a local production of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. We enjoyed it but were disappointed at how many of the interactive portions of the traditional show had been removed due to COVID. The second was at a 4-D movie theatre to watch the release of Dune. With the seats moving us around with the characters and blowing air at our necks and legs, we felt we got more than enough interaction to make up for both shows (spoiler: there was *much* more rain than we expected from a desert planet).
 
Being located on Lake Eerie, Buffalo had an impressive waterfront area. It wasn‚Äôt too busy (likely because of COVID and the colder weather not being too conducive for events) but that just made it easier to walk along the boardwalk.

Our Airbnb was located across the park from Park Vue Soul Food ‚Äì a restaurant that piqued our interest as we really hadn‚Äôt had soul food since graduating from college and leaving Alabama. Natalie also discovered that this restaurant had been featured on a TV show she had often watched on Food Network when she was younger ‚Äì Restaurant: Impossible! We were surprised to learn that the restaurant wasn‚Äôt featured in an older episode but instead had been shot and aired in 2021. We enjoyed some delicious food and got to talk with the owner about the realities of being on the show and what had changed since getting the makeover.

One night, we bought tickets to see a Dueling Pianos show in Buffalo‚Äôs entertainment district. We had originally bought budget tickets that placed us on the second floor a bit away from the main stage. However, when we arrived, they must have decided to only leave the first floor open and we ended up getting seated right next to the main stage üòÖ. Both pianists were local and quite talented. They accepted bribes donations to play song suggestions from an impressively large collection of songs. Natalie REALLY wanted to hear them play Mr Blue Sky by Electric Light Orchestra and was a bit disappointed to not have her request taken even after some pretty generous offerings.

Even with Buffalo‚Äôs very close proximity to Canada, we were still surprised to see so many Canadian flags strung up alongside USA ones across the city. It seemed like there were several aspects of Canada sprinkled throughout the metro area. Most notably were the sheer number of Tim Hortons locations. A franchise that Spencer had never heard of before and Natalie had only seen in Toronto, these are donut and coffee shops that seemed to have a dedicated fanbase. We were both fans of their Timbits (donut holes) but Natalie thought their coffee was just OK (sorry Canada).
 
Of course, It would have been abhorrent if we visited Buffalo without trying any Buffalo Wings. We found a place called Allentown Pizza in a cool area called, well, Allentown, that we explored after eating a delicious vegan pickle pizza and seitan wings.

The main reason most people stay in Buffalo, as we soon learned, is to serve as an inexpensive home base when visiting Niagara Falls. The town of Niagara is a short drive north of Buffalo and even closer to the Canadian border than Buffalo is. In fact, while viewing the falls, you can see Canada right across the river with a parallel set of attractions for the natural wonder. Packed with tourists from seemingly all over the world, we were glad to get close enough to get some clear pictures of the falls.

After getting shots above, we took a trip on the famous Maid of the Mist boat tour to get a much closer (also much less dry) look.

During our time in Buffalo, a group of Natalie‚Äôs friends planned a meetup in Baltimore, Maryland. Spencer decided to fly down to visit his college roommate in Richmond, Virginia at the same time. We then met back up in D.C. If you're interested, you can see a compilation of pictures from our time there here:

To get the fall colors we so desperately sought after, we journeyed a bit outside of Buffalo to visit Letchworth State Park. Known as ‚Äúthe Grand Canyon of the East‚Äù, we were very impressed with the park‚Äôs scale and beauty. Neither of us have been to the Grand Canyon, but hopefully later down the line we can confirm if that motto is warranted üòâ.

Our Airbnb was a spacious two-bedroom upstairs apartment and - most importantly for working from home - had a great wifi connection. Our host, Leslie, was also wonderful and was quick to solve any problems we encountered.

Buffalo is not likely a place we would move to but we still found a number of enjoyable activities to take part in and around the area.
