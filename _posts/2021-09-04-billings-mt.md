After more than nine hours driving through Idaho, a bit of Wyoming, and much of Montana, we rounded a hill and there in the distance we could see it - Billings! We remarked at how unexpectedly impressive the downtown looked from afar. It was pitch black out and the looming towers and buildings were lit so bright--it honestly looked like something straight out of Willy Wonka. However, the factory-esque look started to make more sense as we drove a little closer - much too close for how much time we had left on our GPS. It was at that point we realized that what we were actually seeing was a large oil refinery in Laurel, Montana, just 20 minutes away from our Airbnb.

//Pretty impressive looking refinery though! 

After laughing over our joint misconception, we finished the final leg of our trip and entered the sleeping town of Billings. It’s funny to think now how it felt arriving in the night, passing unfamiliar roads and places and gathering first impressions, now that we’ve travelled most of them and became comfortable navigating without GPS. 

The Airbnb we were staying at was located just a few blocks from downtown. The host knew we’d be coming in late and so told us that he lived offsite and would leave the door unlocked before heading to his own place to sleep. We circled the block detailed in our instructions more than three times trying to find the entrance to an alleyway that, while on our maps, was difficult to find in the night with surrounding construction. And, even when finding it, we were met with a locked apartment door. 

Though it is rented by itself through Airbnb, the apartment is one of five in a 100+ year old house that had been renovated into separate units. After meeting some of the tenants in one of the other apartments, one offered to help us out of our situation. Our new neighbor donned his climbing shoes, grabbed his chalk bag, and scaled the side of the building to kindly “break-in” to our unit via a much anticipated private rooftop deck. He was successful in his efforts and we were introduced to our home for the next month. Though perhaps a bit worrisome that such a feat was one he so readily offered - and performed without much of a hitch - we were just grateful to not have to be locked out for the night.

The thing about effectively ‘renting’ an Airbnb ahead of time is you don’t really know what you’re truly getting yourself into until you are there. You’re basically going off of whatever curated photos have been uploaded to the site and assuming other reviewers have a similar set of criteria for what makes something a one, two, etc. star property. Showing up you can only hope things meet your expectations and if they don’t, well, hopefully you’re able to lie to yourself 🙂. 

We thought we’d have to do a bit more lying than we hoped. For Natalie, the appearance and layout of the rooms were much different from her mental map. The bedroom was truly that - a “bed-room”. Except, more of an alcove than an actual room. It was a mattress placed on the floor at the top of a narrow set of stairs with an even narrower handrail. Besides the alcove, the “upstairs” was a collection of wooden slats nailed together and then attached to the ceiling with a few metal rods (although I’m sure it was engineered a bit better than it sounds). She worried about having to spend an entire month in this place. However, in hindsight, much of that worry could be attributed to this new adventure that we had been planning for months coming to fruition. To be fair, the artificial lighting was not doing the dated interiors any favors.

By the morning, light filled the apartment from the three massive windows in the living room and Natalie’s excitement returned. The apartment was more than well-stocked with appliances, utensils, and enough storage space for twice the amount of things we brought.

The neighborhood runs next to a sprawling park called Pioneer Park which has several tennis courts, an extensive playground (which we of course had to try out), and even yoga on Thursday mornings. On the other side of the neighborhood was a cute cafe-slash-bakery called Harper & Madison, apparently named after the owner's daughters. We enjoyed a delicious breakfast there one morning and it was a good thing we did as they decided to close for good one of the last weekends we were in Billings. 🙁

One of the most impressive things about Billings is its geography. On one side of the city is a tall set of cliffs locally called the Rimrocks that act like a backboard for the local university and a natural overlook for upper class homes. Another side had a tall mountain that gave a good view of the city and the surrounding area.

Wanting to go hiking one weekend, we decided to try and find a path up to that mountain. After driving out a bit, we came across the Four Dances Natural Area which took you on a loop around the top of it and back down and had some truly stunning sights!

On one of Natalie’s drives, she stumbled across the main road that led up to the Rimrocks. It was very steep - so steep, in fact, that it occasionally will close down in poor weather which forces the town’s residents to take the long way to get to the top. We eventually got a chance to drive up there around sunset on a day where the smoky haze that was afflicting a lot of the Northwest during this time wasn’t completely covering the valley.

Being in such a walkable position from downtown, we wanted to explore it as much as possible. 
On one night, the local theatre was having a “Spaghetti Western” night. We learned a bit about the history of Spaghetti Westerns before enjoying a delicious spaghetti dinner and watching the 1966 classic “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly” starring a young Clint Eastwood. It was a first time watch for both of us but we surprisingly both enjoyed it despite its age. 

Spring Fest - an event normally held (unsurprisingly) during the Spring in non-Covid times - was happening one weekend we were in Billings. It’s a collection of artists and local vendors coming together on the lawn of an old historic building in town called Moss Mansion. The fundraiser event provided entertainment, crafts for sale, food, demonstrations, and shows. We bought some local spice mixes and gifts and then watched a group of women and girls from a local competitive clogging team perform. 

We were impressed with the number of food options that existed downtown. Unfortunately, frugality wasn’t a good trait for us to have if we wanted to fully explore the restaurant scene. Of the many highly rated places that call Billings home, we were only able to visit a few. One of those was a delicious Thai place called Imperial Thai.

One of the many monikers for Billings is “Montana’s Trailhead”. While not as mountainous or immediately beautiful as some of the other famous Montana cities, it is in a great position for venturing out in this part of the country. 

For a short trip, we headed out to Pictographic State Park just outside of the city. It served to preserve an area that has had cave drawings over several generations of human history. Though the pictographs themselves had definitely faded over time through weather or human intervention, it was still fascinating to read about.

We also took two different weekend trips, that can be read about in more detail here: 

> Epping, ND
> Cody, WY

On our last night in Billings, after packing up all of our luggage, we took a trip downtown to a restaurant called The Marble Table. We split an appetizer of burrata (which Natalie had always wanted to try) and a “grilled” Caesar salad. Fun fact: anchovies are a common ingredient in Caesar dressing, but typically they’re not in the whole form like they were in this salad. Neither of us had had an anchovy before and doubt we’ll be doing so again soon.

Walking back from the restaurant, we stumbled upon the town’s annual Labor Day car show. We were unsure how long the show had been occurring, but we made it in time to see more than 50 cars drive by. A car show wouldn’t have been our first choice on a Friday night, but it ended up being quite cool and a seemingly very anticipated event for the people of Billings.

More than one person we encountered while in Billings mentioned that they had moved away in their youth but were eventually drawn back. After immersing ourselves in Billings life, I can see why they say that. The small town feel, stunning views, and variety of activities made Billings a great month-long home we might be drawn back to as well.
