We're both recent graduates of The University of Alabama where we met in 2018. After living our entire lives in our home states - Spencer in Idaho and Natalie in Wisconsin - spending four years in the south was a change of pace. Experiencing a new culture and making friends from all over the country encouraged us to continue exploring new places after earning our degrees.

Given the rising availability of telecommuting and independent contracting opportunities, we realized that we didn't have to wait until retirement to travel. We're grateful for this ability to visit places unknown to us and become residents - if only for a month at a time.

Our intent is to post updates after we finish each of our stays. We hope you enjoy reading about our travels as much as we enjoy sharing them with you.
